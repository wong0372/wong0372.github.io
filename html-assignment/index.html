    </header>

        <p>Hello, My name is Ching Man Wong, you can call me Emma. I am from Hong Kong and previously worked in the field of accounting. I like baking, sewing, drawing and travelling.</p>

        <p>A few years back, I was in Japan on a working holiday scheme. Most of my time, I stayed in various guesthouses to be a helper. I love the guesthouse culture and want to build up my guesthouse as well. Learning design can help to build up my own brand and marketing efforts. I am now learning the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and hope I can boost my skill in this fleid.
        </p>
