      Hello, My name is Ching Man Wong, you can call me Emma. I am from Hong
      Kong and previously worked in the field of accounting. I like baking,
      sewing, drawing and travelling.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few years back, I was in Japan on a working holiday scheme. Most of my
      time, I stayed in various guesthouses to be a helper. I love the
      guesthouse culture and want to build up my guesthouse as well. Learning
      design can help to build up my own brand and marketing efforts. I am now
      learning the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and hope
      I can boost my skill in this fleid.
